/**
 * A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number.
 * For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that
 * 28 is a perfect number.
 * <p>
 * A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called
 * abundant if this sum exceeds n.
 * <p>
 * As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written
 * as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers
 * greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot
 * be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be
 * expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
 * <p>
 * Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
 * <p>
 * ==================
 * This is a doozy...
 * So we need to find all Abundant numbers - numbers for which the proper divisors (method available in
 * Factors class) sum to greater than the number itself; so it will include naturally highly divisible numbers
 * <p>
 * Abundant numbers may continue past 28123, but we only care up to that bound as anything else can be written
 * as the sum of smaller abundant numbers. So we have a 28123 element hashset, and remove elements we can make
 * as a result of each abundant sum. This includes multiples of the sums.
 * If an abundant sum is a multiple of a smaller abundant sum, it can be discounted from our list as it's
 * covered by its lesser factor.
 * <p>
 * First, let's find how many abundant numbers there are: There are 6965.
 * I see 12, 24, 36, 48... many more multiples of 12.
 * <p>
 * OH except I read the question wrong - It's about the positive integers written as the sum of TWO abundant numbers;
 * okay, so no removal of powers, and this becomes O(n^2) problem
 * <p>
 * ----
 * Attempt 1: 52749780 - Wrong! But why? :(
 * Attempt 2:  4179871 - streamlined a few things, but what really changed the answer was just tossing out any sum that
 * was greater than 28123, as noted in the question. Why that made a difference is unclear.
