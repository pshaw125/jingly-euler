/**
 * It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.
 * <p>
 * âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...
 * <p>
 * By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
 * <p>
 * 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...
 * <p>
 * The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example
 * where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
 * <p>
 * In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than denominator?
 * <p>
 * =================================
 * Notes
 * <p>
 * So we don't actually need to worry about double type precision if we expand the fractions ourselves.
 * Apache commons math handles the reduce function for finding lowest common denominators.
 * The result of my first pass is actually the same whether or not the reduce function is in there, so I'm not even
 * sure it makes a difference.
 *
 * The fractions represented as numbers actually really quickly overflowed what a long could handle.
 *
 * Anyway:
 * Attempt 1 - 153 - Correct!
 * You are the 33178th person to have solved this problem.
 * This problem had a difficulty rating of 5%.
